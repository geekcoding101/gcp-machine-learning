# GCP Machine Learning Engineering Course

A comprehensive, up-to-date machine learning engineering curriculum with practical implementations, designed for cloud practitioners transitioning into ML engineering.

## üéØ Project Overview

This repository contains hands-on machine learning tutorials, Jupyter notebooks, and resources following a professional ML engineering curriculum structure. While inspired by Google Cloud's ML certification path, the content is platform-agnostic and updated for 2024, incorporating the latest ML practices and technologies.

## üåü Background & Motivation

As a certified Azure AI Engineer Associate, I found that while cloud certifications provide excellent coverage of cloud-specific AI services, they often don't delve deep enough into core machine learning concepts and implementation details. While exploring advanced learning paths, I discovered the "Preparing for Google Cloud Certification: Machine Learning Engineer Professional Certificate" on Coursera. However, many learners noted that the content was outdated.

This led me to create this project: following the well-structured curriculum of the Google Cloud ML certification path, but with completely updated content, modern tools, and platform-agnostic approaches. My goal is to help other cloud practitioners bridge the gap between cloud-specific AI services and fundamental machine learning engineering.

## üìö Course Structure
